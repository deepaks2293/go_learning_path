Go code can be divided up into blocks, segments of code. Blocks are usually surrounded by curly braces ({}), although there are also blocks at the source code file and package levels. Blocks can be nested inside one another.

Each variable you declare has a scope: a portion of your code that it’s “visible” within. A declared variable can be accessed anywhere within its scope, but if you try to access it outside that scope, you’ll get an error.

A variable’s scope consists of the block it’s declared in and any blocks nested within that block.
