But if you know what the initial value of a variable is going to be as soon as you declare it, it’s more typical to use a short variable declaration. Instead of explicitly declaring the type of the variable and later assigning to it with =, you do both at once using :=.

There’s no need to explicitly declare the variable’s type; the type of the value assigned to the variable becomes the type of that variable.

Because short variable declarations are so convenient and concise, they’re used more often than regular declarations. You’ll still see both forms occasionally, though, so it’s important to be familiar with both.
