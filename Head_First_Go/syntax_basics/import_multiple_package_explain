Once we’ve imported the math and strings packages, we can access the math package’s Floor function with math.Floor, and the strings package’s Title function with strings.Title.

The math.Floor and strings.Title functions are both examples of functions that use return values. The math.Floor function takes a floating-point number, rounds it down to the nearest whole number, and returns that whole number. And the strings.Title function takes a string, capitalizes the first letter of each word it contains (converting it to “title case”), and returns the capitalized string.
