Weâ€™ve been passing strings as arguments to Println. A string is a series of bytes that usually represent text characters. You can define strings directly within your code using string literals: text between double quotation marks that Go will treat as a string.

Within strings, characters like newlines, tabs, and other characters that would be hard to include in program code can be represented with escape sequences: a backslash followed by characters that represent another character.

Escape sequence 	Value
\n 	A newline character.
\t 	A tab character.
\" 	Double quotation marks.
\\ 	A backslash.
