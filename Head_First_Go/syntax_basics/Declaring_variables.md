In Go, a variable is a piece of storage containing a value. You can give a variable a name by using a variable declaration. Just use the var keyword followed by the desired name and the type of values the variable will hold.

Once you declare a variable, you can assign any value of that type to it with = (that’s a single equals sign):

You can assign values to multiple variables in the same statement. Just place multiple variable names on the left side of the =, and the same number of values on the right side, separated with commas.

If you know beforehand what a variable’s value will be, you can declare variables and assign them values on the same line:

You can assign new values to existing variables, but they need to be values of the same type. Go’s static typing ensures you don’t accidentally assign the wrong kind of value to a variable.

If you assign a value to a variable at the same time as you declare it, you can usually omit the variable type from the declaration. The type of the value assigned to the variable will be used as the type of that variable.
