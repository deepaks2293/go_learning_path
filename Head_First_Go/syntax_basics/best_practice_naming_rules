A name must begin with a letter, and can have any number of additional letters and numbers.

If the name of a variable, function, or type begins with a capital letter, it is considered exported and can be accessed from packages outside the current one. (This is why the P in fmt.Println is capitalized: so it can be used from the main package or any other.) If a variable/function/type name begins with a lowercase letter, it is considered unexported and can only be accessed within the current package.


/////////////////////////////////////////////not mandate but best practice

If a name consists of multiple words, each word after the first should be capitalized, and they should be attached together without spaces between them, like this: topPrice, RetryConnection, and so on. (The first letter of the name should only be capitalized if you want to export it from the package.) This style is often called camel case because the capitalized letters look like the humps on a camel.

When the meaning of a name is obvious from the context, the Go community’s convention is to abbreviate it: to use i instead of index, max instead of maximum, and so on. (However, we at Head First believe that nothing is obvious when you’re learning a new language, so we will not be following that convention in this book.)
