You can also define numbers directly within your code, and it’s even simpler than string literals: just type the number.


Math operations and comparisons

Go’s basic math operators work just like they do in most other languages. The + symbol is for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division.


You can use < and > to compare two values and see if one is less than or greater than another. You can use == (that’s two equals signs) to see if two values are equal, and != (that’s an exclamation point and an equals sign, read aloud as “not equal”) to see if two values are not equal. <= tests whether the first value is less than or equal to the second, and >= tests whether the first value is greater than or equal to the second.

The result of a comparison is a Boolean value, either true or false
